### a general [S]earch [A]pplication for [R]df data specially designed for [O]pen [C]itations 
A user friendly search platform applicable for any triplestore endpoint.  
This idea came out with regard to the OpenCitations, which contains an open repository of scholarly citation data in RDF format, 
which we would like to make accesible through simple searching operations.  
The current version of the tool is integrated inside the OpenCitations web interface.
